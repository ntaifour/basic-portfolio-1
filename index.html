                <p>Hello, World! My name is Nizar Taifour and I am incredibly excited to be introducing myself in this way. You see, I love technology and can't help but be enamored with thoughts of what's to come. Only thing is, I've gotten tired of looking at a future driven by data human + machine augmentation from the outside, hence why I'm building this site.</p>
                <p>I want to help usher in new advancements in technology and to do so, I have enrolled myself in a developer bootcamp to begin building out skills that will allow me to work alongside pioneers and this site will be part of my training. Check-in periodically to see my progress!</p>
